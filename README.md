# Ghostwriter

A React Native module that types strings on demand. Set up your Ghostwriter with custom options, and watch it do its magic.

Inspired by [Typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/)

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-native-ghostwriter
```

## Demo
[https://github.com/LansanaCamara/react-native-ghostwriter/blob/master/src/demo.gif|alt=React Native Ghostwriter Demo]

## Usage

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import {
    AppRegistry,
    StyleSheet,
    View
} from 'react-native';
import Ghostwriter from 'react-native-ghostwriter';

class App extends Component {
    render() {
        let options = {
            sequences: [
                { string: "A B C", duration: 2000 },
                { string: "It's easy as, 1 2 3", duration: 2500 },
                { string: 'As simple as, do re me' }
            ]
        };

        return (
            <View style={styles.container}>
                <Ghostwriter options={options} />
            </View>
        );
    }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
        paddingLeft: 25,
        paddingRight: 25
    }
});

AppRegistry.registerComponent('App', () => App);
```
